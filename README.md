# Computational Workflow in Matlab for the Iris Dataset

We present a summary of steps to cluster the [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). The dataset includes 150 data samples with 4 features. There are 3 types of flowers including:
- Iris Setosa, 
- Iris Versicolour, and 
- Iris Virginica.

## Setup

We use [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) to process the data. Succssful installation of Matlab on the system is required. 
Used version of Matlab and internal packages are provided at the end of [cluster_iris.pdf](cluster_iris.pdf) file. 

## Run

1. Open [cluster_iris.mlx] file.
2. Click on `Run` button.
